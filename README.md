# OctoPrint-ForceLogin

----

**Note** Works only with current development versions of OctoPrint (1.3.0-dev)
since it necessitates a plugin type not available in the current stable
versions. Only provided as an example for other developers for now, do not use!

----

Disables guest mode by forcing users to login to access the regular web interface.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
